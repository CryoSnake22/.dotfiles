Our aim is to learn more about how developers prefer to collaborate with AI tools, which development workflows benefit most from working with the agent, and how we can make the agent experience more intuitive.\n\nThis is an early version of the product experience, and it's likely to evolve as we learn more about developer preferences. Claude Code is an early look into what's possible with agentic coding, and we know there are areas to improve. We plan to enhance tool execution reliability, support for long-running commands, terminal rendering, and Claude's self-knowledge of its capabilities -- as well as many other product experiences -- over the coming weeks.\n\n### Reporting Bugs\n\nWe welcome feedback during this beta period. Use the `/bug` command to report issues directly within Claude Code, or file a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues).\n\n### Data collection, usage, and retention\n\nWhen you use Claude Code, we collect feedback, which includes usage data (such as code acceptance or rejections), associated conversation data, and user feedback submitted via the `/bug` command.\n\n#### How we use your data\n\nWe may use feedback to improve our products and services, but we will not train generative models using your feedback from Claude Code. Given their potentially sensitive nature, we store user feedback transcripts for only 30 days.\n\nIf you choose to send us feedback about Claude Code, such as transcripts of your usage, Anthropic may use that feedback to debug related issues and improve Claude Code's functionality (e.g., to reduce the risk of similar bugs occurring in the future).\n\n### Privacy safeguards\n\nWe have implemented several safeguards to protect your data, including limited retention periods for sensitive information, restricted access to user session data, and clear policies against using feedback for model training.\n\nFor full details, please review our [Commercial Terms of Service](https://www.anthropic.com/legal/commercial-terms) and [Privacy Policy](https://www.anthropic.com/legal/privacy).\n","readmeFilename":"README.md"}

## Tutorial 7:

1. A computer uses a memory unit with 256K words of 32 bits each. A binary
   instruction code is stored in one word of memory. The instruction has four parts:
   an indirect bit, an operation code, a register code part to specify one of 64
   registers, and an address part.
   a. How many bits are there in the operation code, the register code part, and the
   address part?

32 bit words
I = 1 bit
op code = 7 bits
Register code part = 6 bits
Address Part = 18 bits

# privacy_note

## Important Tools:

### Proton VPN:

Mainly used because it's very privacy concious, open source and based in Norway which is outside of the 14 eyes countries.

```bash
brew install --cask protonvpn
```

### Virtual machine:

Apparently UTM is pretty cool so:

```bash
brew install --cask utm
```

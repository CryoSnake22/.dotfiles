# Summer_2025_MidtermStudies

## Data Structures:

### Midterm 2014:

- Internal vs External Nodes good but:
  - Look into formulas in Assignment

TLDR: Lots of trees:

- [ ] In order traversal
- [ ] Bin array -> max-heap VIA bottom-up heap construction
- [ ] in-place Heapsort algorithm
- [ ] in-place Insertion sort
- [ ] Binary search number of comparisons
- [ ] Show tree after inserting a key (Binary tree) AND DELETING
- [ ] Formulas for trees with depth, i, e etc.

## Computer Architecture

Syntax for memory instructions

```TYPST
Write: M[AR] <- DR
```

- Arithmetic shift
  - Doesn't change the sign bit
  - Pads with the sign bit (so 10001 -> 11110001 for 3 bit shift)
- Fucking weird shit with memory blocks, to look into.
